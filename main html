  <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <div class="Text1"     > 
    
    Queen is a British rock band founded in 1970 by its singer, Freddie Mercury, Brian May on guitar, Roger Taylor on drums and John Deacon on bass. Despite the absence of some of its members, the band was active until 2009.

Brian May and Roger Taylor founded the band Smile in 1968, with Tim Staffell as the vocalist. He studied with Freddie Mercury at Ealing Art College, who was a big fan of the band. Therefore, when Tim Staffell left the group to join another, Humpy Bong, May and Taylor immediately thought of Mercury. Once the three of them were together, Smile’s name became Queen’s at the suggestion of Freddie himself. After playing songs of other bands and artists, they renewed some that they had composed for Smile and other previous bands.</p>

  <h2>HOW DOES IT ENDS</h2>
 <div class="Text1"     > 
    In 1987, Mercury’s couple, Jim Hutton, announced that the singer had AIDS, although all the members of the band denied it. However, in 1991 Mercury said in a statement that he did have the disease. In this same text, he asked for the support of his public and his friends to fight against the disease. Despite this, two days later, on November 24, Freddie Mercury died at only 45 years old.

After the death of the singer, an album with the greatest hits of the band was released, a commemorative concert was made and the album Made in Heaven and the song “No-One, but You” were published. The band entered the hall of fame in 2001 and the following year they got a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2004, Brian May and Roger Taylor announced that they would join with Paul Rodgers to form Queen + Paul Rodgers. In 2008, the new group released the album The Cosmos Rocks, and finally separated in 2009.</p>
